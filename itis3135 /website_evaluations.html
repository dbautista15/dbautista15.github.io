		<h3>Website #1: Apple.com</h3>
		<p>- Apple.com is a great example of a well-designed website. The site has a clean and minimalist look, with an
			intuitive navigation system that makes it easy to find what you're looking for. The layout is visually
			appealing, with high-quality images and graphics, and the site is optimized for both desktop and mobile
			devices. The color scheme is cohesive and consistent throughout, giving the site a professional and polished
			appearance. Overall, Apple.com is a well-designed website that provides a great user experience and
			effectively showcases the company's products and services. </p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Website #2: craiglist.org</h3>
		<p> - Craigslist.org is an example of a poorly designed website. The site has a cluttered and outdated
			appearance,
			with a confusing navigation system that makes it difficult to find what you're looking for. The layout is
			unappealing and lacks visual consistency, with low-quality images and graphics. The site is not optimized
			for mobile devices, and the text is small and difficult to read on smaller screens. The color scheme is
			inconsistent, giving the site a disorganized and amateurish look. Overall, Craigslist.org is a poorly
			designed website that fails to provide a good user experience and fails to effectively showcase the services
			it offers. </p>

		<h3>CRAP Principles Assessment: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Contrast: </b><br>- Apple has lot of great examples of contrast throughout their
				website.
				The sizes of everything is big enough to read and the colors are easy on the eyes. The location of the
				blocks are evenly placed and the site is symmetrical which I find visually appealing. The information is
				organized very well and not over complicated or overwhelming. It is sleek and minimal and does a great
				job at accentuating the important details. <br>- Craiglist in my opinion lacks contrast. The site can be
				hard to navigate because it's overwhelming. It is hard to know what you are looking at without clicking
				on it. there is lack of structure or blocks. There are no lines or divisions so its hard to look for
				what you want. the website is not meaningful or memorable its very static.
			</li>
			<li><b>Repetition: </b><br>- Apple effectively uses repetition in their web design to create a cohesive and
				consistent user experience. They have a consistent layout throughout their site, with similar styles and
				font sizes used in different sections. The color scheme is consistent, with the company's signature
				colors of white, black, and silver being used throughout the site. The use of graphics and images is
				also consistent, with high-quality images used consistently to showcase their products. Apple also has a
				clear hierarchy in their web design, with important information and links being prominently displayed
				and easily accessible. These elements of repetition help to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use
				website that effectively showcases the company's products and services. <br>- Craigslist lacks
				repetition in their web design in several ways. The site has an inconsistent layout, with different
				sections having different styles, font sizes, and color schemes. The use of graphics and images is
				inconsistent, with some sections having high-quality images and others having low-quality images. The
				site also lacks a clear hierarchy, with important information and links not being prominently displayed
				or easily accessible. The site does not have a consistent visual language, which makes it difficult for
				users to understand how to navigate the site and quickly find what they're looking for. Overall, these
				factors contribute to a lack of repetition and cohesiveness in the web design of Craigslist. </li>
			<li><b>Alignment: </b><br> - Apple uses alignment in their web design to create a visually appealing and
				organized look. The site has a clean and minimalist layout, with elements aligned to a grid system that
				creates a sense of order and balance. Text is aligned consistently, with headings and subheadings
				aligned to the left and body text aligned to the left or justified. Images and graphics are aligned with
				the grid, creating a harmonious look. Buttons and links are also aligned consistently, making it easy
				for users to see where they can click to access different parts of the site. These alignments help to
				create a professional and polished appearance, making it easier for users to navigate the site and find
				what they're looking for. <br>- Craigslist lacks alignment in their web design, which contributes to a
				cluttered and unappealing look. Elements on the site are not aligned to a grid system, resulting in a
				lack of balance and symmetry. Text is not aligned consistently, with headings, subheadings, and body
				text appearing misaligned. Images and graphics are not aligned with the text, and some appear to be
				floating randomly on the page. Buttons and links are not aligned consistently, making it difficult for
				users to understand where they can click to access different parts of the site. These issues with
				alignment create a disorganized and amateurish appearance, which can make it difficult for users to
				navigate the site and find what they're looking for. </li>
			<li><b>Proximity: </b><br>- Apple does not lack proximity in their web design. In fact, they effectively use
				proximity to create a clean and organized look. The site has clear grouping and spacing between
				elements, making it easy for users to distinguish between different sections and understand the
				relationships between different pieces of information. The text is well spaced and easy to read, with
				headings, subheadings, and body text appearing in a clear and organized manner. Images and graphics are
				positioned close to the relevant text, making it easy to understand their context. Buttons and links are
				positioned close to the relevant content, making it easy for users to see where they can click to access
				different parts of the site. These effective uses of proximity help to create a clean and organized
				look, making it easy for users to navigate the site and find what they're looking for.<br>- Craigslist
				lacks proximity in their web design, which contributes to a cluttered and disorganized look. The site

				cramped and difficult to read, with headings, subheadings, and body text appearing close together.
