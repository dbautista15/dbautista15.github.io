			remodelation, landscaping, and a mechanic shop. I have been working at a moving company since I moved here
			two years ago.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Academic Background:</h3>
		<p>Came to UNCC from Wake Tech. With an interest in computer science specifically software engineering.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Background In This Subject:</h3>
		<p>I would mess around with a lot of different areas such as pentesting web development and of course data
			structures and algorithms but all of it self taught. I like messing with the raspberry pis or arduino's.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Primary Computer Platform:</h3>
		<p> Right now I am using a Macbook.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Courses Im Taking & Why:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>3112 ITSC - Design and Implemented Object-Oriented Systems:</b> In-depth exploration of
				object-oriented programming and system development. Topics include: evolution of object-oriented
				methodology; concept of the object-oriented approach; object-oriented programming languages;
				object-oriented analysis and design; the design of software for reuse; and incremental software
				development. </li>
			<li><b>1242 MAT - Calculus II:</b> Methods for evaluating definite integrals, applications of integration,
				improper integrals, infinite series, Taylor series, power series, and introduction to differential
				equations..</li>
			<li><b>3135 ITIS - Web App Design and Development:</b> Design and programming concepts for developing
				interactive web based applications: HTML, CSS, the Document Object Model (DOM), event-driven
				programming, client side scripting, and web security considerations. </li>
			<li><b>3200 ITIS - Intro to Info Security and Privacy:</b> An introductory overview of key issues and
				solutions for information security and privacy. Topics include: security concepts and mechanisms;

				cryptography and its applications; intrusion detection and prevention; information systems assurance;
				anonymity and privacy issues for information systems. </li>
			<li><b>3155 ITSC - Software Engineering:</b>An introduction to software engineering, which advances the
				study and application of engineering principles, methods, and techniques that can help us to improve the
				process of creating software as well as the resulting software products. The course covers fundamentals
				of software engineering, including: modern software process models; eliciting, specifying, and
				evaluating software system requirements; designing software systems to embody required quality
				attributes, including usability and security; an introduction to reusable software design solutions in
				the form of software architectural styles and design patterns; software system modeling, implementation,
				and deployment; and software quality assurance (measurement, inspection, testing). Project planning,
				working in teams, and using modern software development tools are also explored. </li>
